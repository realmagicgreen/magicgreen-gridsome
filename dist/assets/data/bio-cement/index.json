We decided to create a prototype section of external wall as our Re-Made project to test this possibility.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Creating the structure with Sharjah sand is not straightforward, even with BioMason’s strong, existing ties with this part of the world.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We first used the sands and indigenous a regates in Sharjah in 2009 when we created the technology,\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>says Krieg Dosier.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We will seek to bring this technology full circle by using Sharjah a regates to produce our BioLith tile product, the company’s main product for commercial and residential applications, as a building façade material.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The collaborator team agrees that more research and strength tests will be needed to ensure the end product’s workability.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"BioMason’s process enables materials to be formed in ambient temperatures by replacing the curing process with the formation of biologically controlled structural cement.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For Re-Made, the team is trying to reimagine an element from the museum’s structure as a shelving unit built of biocement.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Fish use coral reefs as places to graze and explore. I think a shelving system can have a similar feeling for people.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The piece may even become part of the museum, when it opens.</p>\n<p>But the point of this project goes beyond its practical applications.</p>\n<p>There’s a deep, conceptual and symbolic value to the experiment.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"BioMason was founded by two architects who worked in the UAE from 2007 to 2014.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Illustrates Krieg Dosier.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Re-Made project continues that narrative, expressing regionalism and reverence to other building materials used in the UAE. This project, design and collaboration are a proud and compassionate statement to working with materials found on site and our responsibility to place and environment.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Khan feels <em>\"Coral Reef\"</em> is an exciting challenge:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I like that this project gave me the opportunity of remaking something that was precious to us the museum’s original design]. Perhaps we should all challenge our design assumptions more often.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Know more:</em></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.biomason.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Biomason - website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/6BqoM4am8kw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Ginger Krieg Dosier presents the idea - Youtube</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/biomason\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Biomason - IG</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/biomason\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Biomason - Twitter</a></p>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/bio-cement.07cc2b7.bb6f2ad8e497b98245fe971750df7ad8.jpg","size":{"width":860,"height":484},"sizes":"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px","srcset":["/assets/static/bio-cement.a67b0b2.bb6f2ad8e497b98245fe971750df7ad8.jpg 480w","/assets/static/bio-cement.07cc2b7.bb6f2ad8e497b98245fe971750df7ad8.jpg 860w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 860 484' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-a3404ee8a7c45337320ddb52f977646b'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='10'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-a3404ee8a7c45337320ddb52f977646b)' width='860' height='484' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bjxSyXduHV9ssiKSrME4DccUqXFsMt4Z5B8P8UBLcPCkLLGzZ2kDCN5e1NW5QEAHI9Bgikn1K3kIciXaB4rVOa%2btC7HKrjyYcfNAaT3ymMjBBPRtpqnNqNtvcXMwEm3HeQ9P1UcV7p0uAs6szHAAYZJ9qzNUtO2k7WMghgBy3XFEDbtJ45rW4WG32uxHOePHvEf9mmaskkNviM7VVcnK/iBg4984J9cDwrMeVVnkjiXIRsbs4zj0oKh2VmWOQowcbgSAQeOtQE1hDM8SlFkMYGBgYz5n3qlKZUuipLsD3hxxn2q3NeXM7SOL28QcghZzgn1BBB/VYOp2dreOqaharcK3eDRJHDtGfNVBqa/w3k%2bmbUUiS2zCYlQRhQV4rPtNEm1WeSK07J51TcIy4VnGf4561yGpabZ6I0moaa2o2ssYYxSWzlnXjkH09aj%2blfucxnWH64sU1CHOI9QhQR3EIx0JXG4fNRus7I1Ew2upnTrZSWOrxRXNvNbSo2QGjK5PPdOfHxBranvo4IHlmQCKNRuII6%2bdLqX3V0y/0xrbSQtzMV2RrcNv2r/ZucnFeTfVd3qeoRx5uxKqNkQnC59QBj5rXHtLWsJyyoeJ6eqPbK0sh3uAckgEY/1TAjCQbZpAOmBjB%2bKKKpx%2bh6htyqHIViSQAPAe1VJ4%2b0cqzvjI6YooqGiGWPhe83B4rzn7h6Zb2Wpo1sGRJmZjEMbEPB7ox60UVZ8g4ucGCWOWFikigMGU8g811cs8k87tKcqrhAnRTnZyfP8AI9aKK6IjP//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},"context":{}}
