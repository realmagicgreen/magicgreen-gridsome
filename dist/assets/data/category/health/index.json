Coats</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And it's for these exact reasons that Ayurveda refers to aloe vera as the miracle herb that can be used to treat wounds, minor cuts, dry skin and severe burns.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Aloe Vera is rich in Vitamin C, E and beta carotene which gives it its nourishing and anti-ageing qualities. It can moisturise the skin without making it greasy, which makes it a great buy for those with oily skin.\" <em>Dr. Deepali Bhardwaj Delhi-based dermatologist</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She also suggests drinking aloe vera juice early in the morning on an empty stomach because it improves digestion and cures any kind of stomach trouble.

With ample amounts of vitamins and minerals that contribute to weight-loss, as well as amino acids, enzymes and sterols, aloe vera ensures your diet is not only supportive of weight-loss, but also improves the body's absorption and utilisation, improving overall health as well as weight-loss success.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"aloe-vera-for-hairfall\"><a href=\"#aloe-vera-for-hairfall\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Aloe vera for hairfall</h2>\n<p>Aloe vera contains something called proteolytic enzymes which repairs dead skin cells on the scalp. It also acts as a great conditioner and leaves your hair all smooth and shiny. It promotes hair growth, prevents itching on the scalp, reduces dandruff and conditions your hair.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Keratin, the primary protein of hair, consists of amino acids, oxygen, carbon, and small amounts of hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulphur. Aloe vera has a chemical make up similar to that of keratin and it rejuvenates the hair with its own nutrients, giving it more elasticity and preventing breakage.\" <em>Diane Gage, author of Aloe Vera: Nature's Soothing Heale</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Know more:</em></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloe_vera\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Aloe Vera - wikipedia</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jenreviews.com/grow-aloe-vera/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">How to Grow an Aloe Vera Plant: Care, Types, and Growing Tips - Jen Reviews</a></p>\n"}}]}}},"context":{}}
