I realised that by reconnecting with the essence of my childhood, I was creating a new sense for my life, and looking towards an exciting future. Today, I have put all these feelings into 5 Essences, crafted with ancient wisdom and modern techniques. <em>Iris from Live Essences</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>{% include image.html name=\"-04\" caption=\"Live Essences healthy stomach drink\" %}</p>\n<p>Magicgreen asked Iris to share her story:</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-you-got-involved-in-making-healthy-drinks\"><a href=\"#how-you-got-involved-in-making-healthy-drinks\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>How you got involved in making healthy drinks?</h2>\n<p>For the love of medicinal plants, private lessons, online studies on traditional remedies I started developing my first recipe of Jamu, a traditional Indonesian health tonic.</p>\n<p>Supplying the restaurant of my friends surf resort here in Canggu.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-motivates-you-and-where-are-you-going-as-a-company\"><a href=\"#what-motivates-you-and-where-are-you-going-as-a-company\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>What motivates you and where are you going, as a company?</h2>\n<p>My main motivation is to bring ancient knowledge back paying attention to recent/modern research and applying techniques in the way we process the plants into the products, engineering unadulterated natural products.</p>\n<p>{% include image.html name=\"-07\" caption=\"Live Essences processes  plants into drinks\" %}</p>\n<p>Finding natural ways to preserve them.
