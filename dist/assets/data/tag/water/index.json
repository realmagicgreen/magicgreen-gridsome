By choosing not to eat seafood, or as Dr. Earle calls it, marine wildlife, we can help by showing fisheries that there’s less demand for their fish supply and we want them to leave the fish, mollusks and other edible marine life in the sea where it belongs. Of course, many people around the world depend on protein from the ocean to survive, and artisanal fisheries are crucial for many coastal populations. But in America and other developed countries, we have more of a choice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stop-using-single-use-plastics\"><a href=\"#stop-using-single-use-plastics\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Stop using single-use plastics</h3>\n<p>Plastic pollution is clogging up waterways and poisoning marine creatures from sea turtles to fish and seabirds.</p>\n<p>By carrying a reusable water bottle and avoiding using plastic drinking straws, utensils, etc., we can greatly reduce the amount of plastic thrown into landfills that often release plastics into the ocean.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-your-own-special-talent-to-help-fight-for-the-ocean\"><a href=\"#use-your-own-special-talent-to-help-fight-for-the-ocean\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Use your own special talent to help fight for the ocean.</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Look in the mirror, consider your talents, and think about how you might use them to make a difference. Some have artistic skills, others are good with numbers or have a way with words. Everyone has power to make a difference as an individual, or by joining the company of others who share a common goal. The key is in knowing that what you do matters, including doing nothing!\" <em>Dr. Sylvia Earle</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Mission Blue depends on the generosity of people to explore and protect Hope Spots. Every dollar donated helps our continued efforts to inspire a world where the ocean is protected and respected.</em></p>\n<p><em>Now, as never before, we have the chance to save what’s left of the living systems that support life on our planet.
