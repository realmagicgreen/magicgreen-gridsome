By choosing not to eat seafood, or as Dr. Earle calls it, marine wildlife, we can help by showing fisheries that there’s less demand for their fish supply and we want them to leave the fish, mollusks and other edible marine life in the sea where it belongs. Of course, many people around the world depend on protein from the ocean to survive, and artisanal fisheries are crucial for many coastal populations.

Everyone has power to make a difference as an individual, or by joining the company of others who share a common goal. The key is in knowing that what you do matters, including doing nothing!\" <em>Dr. Sylvia Earle</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Mission Blue depends on the generosity of people to explore and protect Hope Spots.
