We decided to create a prototype section of external wall as our Re-Made project to test this possibility.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Creating the structure with Sharjah sand is not straightforward, even with BioMason’s strong, existing ties with this part of the world.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We first used the sands and indigenous a regates in Sharjah in 2009 when we created the technology,\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>says Krieg Dosier.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We will seek to bring this technology full circle by using Sharjah a regates to produce our BioLith tile product, the company’s main product for commercial and residential applications, as a building façade material.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The collaborator team agrees that more research and strength tests will be needed to ensure the end product’s workability.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"BioMason’s process enables materials to be formed in ambient temperatures by replacing the curing process with the formation of biologically controlled structural cement.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For Re-Made, the team is trying to reimagine an element from the museum’s structure as a shelving unit built of biocement.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Fish use coral reefs as places to graze and explore.

This project, design and collaboration are a proud and compassionate statement to working with materials found on site and our responsibility to place and environment.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Khan feels <em>\"Coral Reef\"</em> is an exciting challenge:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I like that this project gave me the opportunity of remaking something that was precious to us the museum’s original design].
